# Flow

A purely visual Android application which is built on the idea of having particles guided by a perlin noise field,
inspired by Dan Shiffman's video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjoM9oKOAKY

The noise implementation is a kotlin translation of Adrian Biagioli's C# implementation OctavePerlin:

This app is developed (and therefore has only been tested) on an API28 device
