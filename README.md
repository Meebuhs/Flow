# Flow

A purely visual Android application which is built on the idea of having particles guided by a perlin noise field and is
 inspired by Dan Shiffman's video available here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjoM9oKOAKY

This app is developed (and therefore has only been tested) on an API28 device
